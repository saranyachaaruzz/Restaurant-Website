    <p class="p1"> The earliest modern-format "restaurants" to
                   use that word in Paris were the establishments 
                   which served bouillon, a broth made of meat and egg
                   which was said to restore health and vigour.
                   The first restaurant of this kind opened in 1765
                   or 1766 by Mathurin Roze de Chantoiseau on rue
                   des Poulies, now part of the Rue de Louvre.The
                   name of the owner is sometimes given as Boulanger.</p>
